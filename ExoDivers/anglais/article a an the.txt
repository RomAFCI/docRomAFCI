You are walking down A street in London when you notice A strange shape in the sky. It looks like A balloon, but it moves like A bird. Intrigued, you follow it until you reach A park near a university.


In A middle of  park, you see A group of people gathered around A cage. Inside, there is AN animal you’ve never seen before.
It resembles A monkey, but it has wings. You take out your phone to take A picture, but A security guard tells you it's not allowed.


You ask him what kind of animal it is. He answers: “It’s A hybrid species created by A team of researchers at THE United Kingdom’s top scientific institute.” You are shocked. He adds: “They’ve been working on this for over A year.”


As you leave A park, you bump into A journalist from THE local newspaper. She says she’s writing AN article about scientific experiments on animals and asks for AN opinion.
You give her your thoughts and she writes them down in A notebook.


Later that day, you decide to relax with A cup of tea at THE café you love near THE river Thames. You read A book you bought earlier that day: it’s about A history of science in Britain. AN author is very famous in A field.


Suddenly, your phone rings. It's A friend from high school, now working as AN employee at AN animal rescue center. You tell her everything and she promises to send you AN email with more information about a project.
